Hello,
To run all tests, compile and run main.cpp.
The result of each test is stored at output_.OUT.
File out_.OUT is the sample output.
This is for reference only. I can't assure you that the sample output is correct.

The print() method was adjusted to make it easier to read.

CONSTRAINT IN THIS TEST:
MAXSIZE <= 5.10^3, Number of queries <=5.10^3.
Time limit for each test: 5s.

If anything is wrong, please contact me: https://www.facebook.com/Ngoclong270604/
